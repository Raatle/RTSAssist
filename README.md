# RTSAssist
RTSAssist is a RTS conversion for Starsector. It does, however, allow switching between RTS
and Vanilla control schemes. Ships can be moved to a position, ordered to attack an enemy ship etc.

RTSAssist does not change or modify the AI but rather restricts it. For example: A ship
is ordered to hold position. The AI is still in full control except that it must stay
at the position that its order commands. What it chooses to attack, when it uses its
systems, how it raises it's shields etc., are all the same, with some exceptions.
When not given an order ships will behave exactly as they do in the vanilla game.

In order to make some ships more wieldy, some ships will have there system use either
disabled or there usecases modified WHEN following a command. On the mod page is a full list
of which ship packs are compatible.

Hotkeys can be changed in the hotkeys.ini file found in this folder.

Finally, I hope you enjoy it. It has been a project of mine for a long, long time. If
you are having trouble micromanaging ships remember the AI is fully capable without you
and sometimes just a little influence makes all the difference.
