# RTSAssist
RTSAssist is a mod that gives some assistance in controlling ships during battle.
Ships can be moved to a position, ordered to attack an enemy ship etc.

This can be considered a feature overhaul in that the player loses control of a single ship
and instead receives extended command over the entire fleet as well as the camera.

It does not change or modify the AI but rather restricts it. For example: A ship
is ordered to hold position. The AI is still in full control except that it must stay
at the position that its order commands. What it chooses to attack, when it uses its
systems, how it raises it's shields etc., are all the same, with some exceptions.
When not given an order ships will behave exactly as they do in the vanilla game.

In order to make some ships more wieldy, some ships will have there system use either
disabled or there usecases modified WHEN following a command.

Hotkeys can be changed in the hotkeys.ini file found in this folder.

Finally, I hope you enjoy it. It has been a project of mine for a long, long time. If
you are having trouble micromanaging ships remember the AI is fully capable without you
and sometimes just a little influence makes all the difference.
