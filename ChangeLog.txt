Version 0.1.6 Patch notes

Support for LunaLib:

    LunaLib is now fully supported.
    Both hotkeys and settings can be adjusted in the Luna GUI, in the main menu.
    All hotkey and settings changes made using Luna will persist even after updating or removing and re-adding this mod.
    The original hotkeys and config file still function for those not using Luna, and for those that are, will act as a defaults settings file.


Save Preservation:

    RTSAssist no longer breaks saves on removal and can be freely added or removed at any time.
    Unfortunately this only applies to saved games created on RTSAssist versions of 0.1.6 or higher.


Ship Selection:

    Selecting ships, both ally and enemy has been problematic in the past. It is now in a far better place.
    New Setting: Selection Tolerance. If a player often tries to a click a ship and misses, this setting can be increased and should remedy that problem. Setting this to 1 removes this feature.
    Previously, ordering a ship to attack at an angle often required a player to pause the game, as if the target ship had moved before finalising the order, it would instead add a dynamic hold on flux command. This is fixed. Take all the time you want selecting that perfect angle.


Newly Supported Mods:

    Apex Design Collective
    Halo Dynamics Ship Industry
    Interstellar Imperium
    Everybody Loves the Ko Combine
    Experimental Ship Pack/ Machina Void Services
    Phillip Andrada Gas Station Manager
    ScalarTech Solutions
    SCY
    Secrets of the Frontier
    Volkov Industrial Conglomerate


Various Fixes and Changes:

    Added a fix for CTD on ship death
    Systems that are not togglable can no longer be deactivated.
    Ships can be be given a assignment and ordered to use their system on the same frame.
    Ships with togglable systems, if manually activated, would no longer obey RTS system logic. This is fixed.
    Previously ships with systems that could not be deactivated could be deactivated using the RTSAssist. This is fixed.
    Remembering zoom on mode switch is now disabled by default. Can be reenabled in Luna or the config file.


Known Issues:

    Switching right click and double click behaviour is bugged temporarily disabled.
    Moving the mouse outside the screen causes it to scroll indefinately.
    Queueing a dynamicHoldOnFlux queues a moveAndHold instead.
    Video feed not working.
