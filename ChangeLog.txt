Version 0.1.6d Patch notes
    Fixed multiple UI issues for users that were using screenscaling.

Version 0.1.6e Patch notes
    Fixed a crash associated with mod interactions that led to ships toggling their weapons between usable and not usable states.
    0.1.6c introduced a camera panning bug when selecting phased ships. This is fixed.
    Added better support for ships that either only used missile weapons or only point defense or only a combination of the two.

Version 0.1.6f Patch notes
    Reworked input framework. All hotkeys can be rebound except modifiers (shift, control and alt).
    Translating and Rotating heavily reworked. Behaviour improved and more consistant.
    New config option, alternative rotation, that requires less user input.
