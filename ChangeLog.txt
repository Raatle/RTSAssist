Version 0.1.6e Patch notes
    Fixed a crash associated with mod interactions that led to ships toggling their weapons between usable and not usable states.
    0.1.6c introduced a camera panning bug when selecting phased ships. This is fixed.
    Added better support for ships that either only used missile weapons or only point defense or only a combination of the two.

Version 0.1.6f Patch notes
    Reworked input framework. All hotkeys can be rebound except modifiers (shift, control and alt).
    Translating and Rotating heavily reworked. Behaviour improved and more consistant.
    New config option, alternative rotation, that requires less user input.

Version 0.1.6g Patch notes
    Fixed CTD introduced in the previous patch. It was produced by rebinding the "enable RTS mode" hotkey and attempting to switch modes.

Version 0.1.6h Patch notes
    Added support for Outer Rim Alliance.
    Fixed a major bug that was heavily distorting the desired ship attack range for ships with heavy broadside modifiers.
