	# If you are using LunaLib, treat this as a defaults key file. I.e., if you reset the keys in the luna menu they'll

	# that any update to RTSAssist will reset this file. I will remedy this but for the time being use Luna.

	# Be aware that while in RTS mode these keys will only interact with the mod and there old functions will be disabled.
	# While not in RTS mode these hotkey will do nothing with the only exception being the ability to toggle RTS mode.
